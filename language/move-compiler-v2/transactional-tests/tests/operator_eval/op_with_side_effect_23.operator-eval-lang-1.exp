+   = To compile this code, either:
+   = 1. upgrade to language version 2.0 or later (which uses strict left-to-right evaluation order),
+   = 2. rewrite the code to remove sequences from directly within binary operations,
+   =    e.g., save intermediate results providing explicit order.
+   = In either of these cases, please ensure to check the code does what you expect it to, because of changed semantics.
